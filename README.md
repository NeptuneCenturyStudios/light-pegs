# electron-vue-vuetify-starter

This template uses Electron, Vue 3, and Vuetify 3 to create powerful cross-platform desktop apps. Vue router is also included. The Vue app is generated with the Vue CLI and the directory structure is unchanged. Electron is installed on top of it and everything is set up to run the Vue app inside Electron.

NOTE: this template is using Vuetify 3 Beta which should not be used in production environments. Once version 3 is released, this template will be updated.
